# Project Name: User Authentication API

## Overview:

An authentication API is a backend service that manages user access and security across applications. Its primary functions include user registration, login, and access control.

When a user registers, the API securely stores their credentials (e.g., hashed passwords) in a database. During login, the API verifies these credentials and generates a token (such as a JWT) if the credentials are valid. This token is then used to authenticate the user for subsequent requests, allowing access to protected resources without requiring them to re-enter their credentials.

By using tokens, the API provides a secure, scalable method for managing user sessions. This is essential for both web and mobile applications that require user accounts, secure access, and personalized content.
